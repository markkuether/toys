- Read All Data
- Calculate IG for all columns.
- Find column with highest IG = X
- Break data into subset per categories within X
- - Per Column category - Test Stop:
- - - Do All data in subset belong to same category? (YES = STOP)
- - - - Assign specific category.
- - - Are other columns available to evaluate? (NO = STOP)
- - - - Majority vote wins
- - - Does category contain any samples? (NO = STOP)
- - - - ?
- - If Not stopped:
- - - Test each subset for IG and repeat until all stopped
